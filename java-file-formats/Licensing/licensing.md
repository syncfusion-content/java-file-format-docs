# Syncfusion Licensing in Java FileFormats

We have introduced a new licensing system for Syncfusion Java FileFormats platform starting from version 19.1.0.x release of Essential Studio. This licensing is apply to all the evaluators and only to paid customers who use Syncfusion Java packages from [maven repository](https://jars.syncfusion.com). If you use the evaluation installer or [maven repository](https://jars.syncfusion.com) to use Syncfusion Java packages, you must also include the corresponding platform and version license key in your projects.

### Difference between unlock key and license key

Please note that this license key is different from the installer unlock key that you might have used in the past and needs to be separately generated from Syncfusion website. Refer [this](https://www.syncfusion.com/kb/8950/difference-between-the-unlock-key-and-licensing-key) KB article to know more about difference between the Syncfusion Unlock Key and the Syncfusion License Key.

Trial message will be displayed as watermark in the generated documents, if Java packages libraries referred from  trial installer or from [maven repository](https://jars.syncfusion.com)
