# Register Syncfusion License key in FileForamt application

The generated license key is just a string that needs to be registered before any Syncfusion control is initiated. The following code is used to register the license.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight c# %}
Syncfusion.Licensing.SyncfusionLicenseProvider.RegisterLicense("YOUR LICENSE KEY");
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

N> * Place the license key between double quotes.  Also, ensure that Syncfusion.Licensing.dll is referenced in your project where the license key is being registered.
* Syncfusion license validation is done offline during application execution and does not require internet access.  Apps registered with a Syncfusion license key can be deployed on any system that does not have an internet connection.

### Java

Recommended place to register the license for Java platform is given below.

Import â€˜syncfusion.licensing' package and register the license key in the **main method** of your console application.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight JAVA %}
// Refer the licensing package
import com.syncfusion.licensing.*;

static void main() { 
// Register Syncfusion license 
SyncfusionLicenseProvider.registerLicense("YOUR LICENSE KEY"); 
}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

N> License key registration is not required for Java before v19.1.
