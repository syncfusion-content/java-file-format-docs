# Working with Document Conversions

The Essential DocIO converts documents from one format to another format. Each file format document can be categorized as a flow layout document.

**Flow layout document:**

* A flow document is designed to "reflow content" depending on application.
* Doesnâ€™t contain any information about the position of its content.
* Dynamically render the content by the application at run time.
* Example: DOCX, HTML and TEXT file formats.

Essential DocIO can convert various flow documents as a fixed-document by using our layout engine. The following conversions are supported by the Essential DocIO.

* Microsoft Word file format Conversions.
* Text Conversions.
* HTML Conversions.
