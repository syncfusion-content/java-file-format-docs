# Overview of Word library (DocIO)

Essential DocIO is a native Java Word library that is used by developers to create, read, write, and convert the Microsoft Word documents in the Java application without Microsoft Word or interop dependencies.

It is a non-UI component that provides a full-fledged document instance model similar to the Microsoft Office COM libraries to iterate with the document elements explicitly and perform necessary manipulation. It is built from scratch in Java and does not require Microsoft Word to be installed in the machine. It supports Word 2007 and later versions documents.
