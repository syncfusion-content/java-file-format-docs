# Overview of Word Library (DocIO)

Essential<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> DocIO is a native Java Word library used by developers to create, read, write, and convert Microsoft Word documents in Java applications without Microsoft Word or interop dependencies.

It is a non-UI component that provides a full-fledged document instance model, similar to the Microsoft Office COM libraries, to interact with document elements explicitly and perform necessary manipulations. It is built from scratch in Java and does not require Microsoft Word to be installed on the machine. It supports Word 2007 and later version documents.

**Key Features**

* Support for [creating Word documents](https://help.syncfusion.com/document-processing/word/word-library/java/getting-started) from scratch.
* Support for opening, modifying, and saving existing Word documents.
* Advanced [Mail Merge](https://help.syncfusion.com/document-processing/word/word-library/java/working-with-mail-merge) support with different data sources.
* Ability to create or edit Word 2007 and later version documents and convert them to commonly used file formats such as [WordML](https://help.syncfusion.com/document-processing/word/word-library/java/word-file-formats#word-processing-xml-xml), [TXT](https://help.syncfusion.com/document-processing/word/word-library/java/text), [HTML](https://help.syncfusion.com/document-processing/word/word-library/java/html) and vice versa.

* Ability to read and write [built-in and custom document properties](https://help.syncfusion.com/document-processing/word/word-library/java/working-with-word-document#working-with-word-document-properties).
* Support for inserting and editing [form fields](https://help.syncfusion.com/document-processing/word/word-library/java/working-with-form-fields).

T> Sometimes a Java application may throw an error like this: "Java.Lang.OutOfMemoryError." Usually, this error occurs due to insufficient RAM heap space to allocate an object in the Java heap. To avoid this kind of problem, we suggest [increasing the JVM heap size](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E29587_01/PlatformServices.60x/ps_rel_discovery/src/crd_advanced_jvm_heap.html).

N> Currently, Essential<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> DocIO supports .DOCX, .DOTX, .DOTM, .DOCM, .WordML, .RTF, .TXT, WordML, and HTML. Please refer to the [supported and unsupported features](https://help.syncfusion.com/document-processing/word/word-library/java/supported-and-unsupported-features) in Essential<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> DocIO.
