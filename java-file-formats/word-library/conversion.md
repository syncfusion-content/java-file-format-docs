# Word Document Conversion

## Working with Document Conversions

The Essential<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> DocIO converts documents from one format to another format. Each file format document can be categorized as flow layout document.

**Flow layout document**

* A flow document is designed to "reflow content" depending on the application.
* Does not contain any information about the position of its content.
* Dynamically renders the content by application at run time.
* Example: DOCX, HTML and TEXT file formats.
