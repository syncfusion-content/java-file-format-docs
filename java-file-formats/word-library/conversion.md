# Word Document Conversion

## Working with Document Conversions

The Essential<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> DocIO converts documents from one format to another format. Each file format document can be categorized as a flow layout document.

**Flow layout document**

* A flow document is designed to "reflow content" depending on the application.
* Does not contain any information about the position of its content.
* Dynamically renders the content by the application at runtime.
* Example: DOCX, HTML, and TEXT file formats.

Essential<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> DocIO can convert various flow documents into fixed documents by using our layout engine. The following conversions are supported by Essential DocIO:

* Microsoft Word file format conversions.
* Text conversions.
* HTML conversions.

## HTML Conversion

Essential<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> DocIO supports converting an HTML file into a Word document and vice versa. It supports only the HTML files that meet the validation requirements against either XHTML 1.0 Strict or XHTML 1.0 Transitional schema.
